# random-colors
Displays weighted random values without user input

Made with Processing 3.3.6

This little project was created to solve a real-world problem: I make
chainmaille as a hobby, and wanted to randomize my usage of two different
materials within the same project. I wanted to do so with minimal
interference to my workflow, so usual methods such as dice were not
ideal. Instead, I can leave this program running somewhere within my
field of view, and simply poll the screen when selecting my next rings.
Large fields of color, and a progress bar that changes color when new data
is about to be presented, mean that my laptop need not be on the same
surface as my work.

Editing the various "final" values allows this program to be used for
other potential use cases. And, of course, I've prettied up the code as
much as I can, because that's what makes a project actually feel complete.
